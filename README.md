# Two algorithms that replicate Bitcoin mining 
## Two fully functional python mock crypto mining algorithms built from scratch with no external libraries
This project was built with no external libraries at all using only core python. It mimics real life crypto mining algorithms and replicates essential components of the actual Bitcoin mining process and produces a hash that can pass as a real bitcoin mining hash. This project:
